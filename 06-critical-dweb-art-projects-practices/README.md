# Praxis 3: Critical DWeb Art Projects + Practices

with Sarah Friend and Ayana Zaire Cotton.

## Overview

Critics have cited a lack of trust in institutions as the impetus for the rise in decentralized web technologies â€” warning about centering individual ownership and the ways extremist views might thrive in these decentralized spaces. How might centering collective ownership and developing praxis rooted in collective imagination allow us to seed ways of working and being on a decentralized web reinforce care instead of conspiracy?

This class will look in depth at approaches to integrating Dweb tools into art practice from curation, to publishing, to studio art and community building. We will kick the session off engaging with case studies of art practices and projects that leverage decentralization as a method of community building followed by an open discussion to critique, synthesize and imagine alongside these case studies. Next up, we will explore some of the tooling behind NFTs and artist DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), ways to hold assets in common. Together we will do a hands-on activity using some of these tools, looking at when they can be helpful as well as their pitfalls. What would a fully Dweb art world look like and is it a world we desire?
