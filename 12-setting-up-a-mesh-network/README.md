# Praxis 5: Setting up a Mesk Network

with Sarah Grant

## Overview

So much of what we do online doesn't need to depend on third-party commercial hosting and internet providers. By building our own decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructures, we are able to better address issues around privacy, access, and control of our data and communication networks, potentially building safer online spaces for our communities to interact with each other.

In this hands-on session, you will be guided through the installation, configuration and deployment of a basic mesh network. As we build, we will consider questions around the control of data and network infrastructure tied to the larger themes of access, power, resilience and sustainability. Participants will be introduced to many practical concepts, including the basic building blocks of the command Line interface, computer networking, configuring a server for hosting web sites, 'captive portals' and peer-to-peer file sharing. By the end of the session, we will leave with a functional mesh network ready to be deployed in the world!

### Learning Outcomes

* How to set up mesh network using off-the-shelf hardware.
* Understanding which scenarios are best served by a mesh network.
* Learning how to host and share files across a mesh network.

### Materials Needed

* A computer or device with Zoom installed, with camera and microphone.
* Raspberry Pi 3+ with an SD card already flashed with Raspbian Lite.
* Ethernet cable and adapter for connecting our Pi to our computer.
* A WiFi radio that supports “mesh” mode. [See this document for models and purchasing links](praxis-5-wifi-radio-links.pdf).
* A simple website to share over the network.

### Prerequisites

* No experience necessary, although one would benefit from having taken the Command Line for Creatives session beforehand.
* Patience and perseverance.
