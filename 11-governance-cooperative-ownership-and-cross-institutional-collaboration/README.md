# Session 7: Governance, Cooperative Ownership, and Cross-institutional Collaboration

with Kelani Nicole

## Overview

The cultural sector is experiencing radical change – everything from infrastructure and funding to programming is shifting amid growing economic and political instability. Cooperative forms of resilience are emerging, powered by decentralized principles of transparency, solidarity and adaptability. Institutions are finding ways to cooperate and share resources and knowledge, and exploring how decentralized infrastructure can create systems of mutual support.

In this session, we will share case studies from across the cultural sector shining on artists, organizations and institutions exploring decentralized principles and cooperative structures. We’ll discuss governance models and the patterns of human coordination that underlie cooperative efforts. In a workshop session, participants will be invited to contribute their experiences with solidarity economies surrounding their practice, which powers much of the emerging cultural sector. Together we’ll create a generative model for building new forms of cooperation and resilience as a blueprint to deploy in your own work.

### Learning Outcomes

* Understanding governance models in DWeb, and how automation can be deployed alongside human labor to create operational efficiencies.
* Survey of the ecosystem of cooperative efforts, solidarity economies, and cross-organizational initiatives as a blueprint for forming mutually beneficial intra-institutional collaborations.
* Hands-on participation in modeling cultural infrastructure backed by decentralized principles and tooling.

### Materials Needed

* A computer or device with Zoom installed, with camera and microphone.
* A free Miro account.

### Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of Decentralized Networks.
