# DWeb Lexicon and Ecosystem

With Sarah Grant, Regina Harsanyi, and ngọc triệu.

## Overview

You have heard the term “decentralization“. Maybe you’ve even consciously participated in a platform, application or group that claims to tagsuse decentralized tools. This course will help complete beginners gain the knowledge needed to confidently engage in a conversation about decentralization but also help those who have come to this curriculum with knowledge of decentralization unlearn prevailing misconceptions.

We’ll look at the current ecosystem of the decentralized web (DWeb), offering a comprehensive perspective on its technological, social, and historical evolution. With a broad view of the landscape, participants will develop critical thinking skills essential for navigating and contributing to the discourse on decentralized and distributed systems in a meaningful way.

As we define terms and break down how companies use or don’t use decentralized tools, you’ll be able to answer questions like “What does it actually mean for something to be decentralized” and “How does one actively participate in decentralization?”
