# Session 1: Introduction to Decentralized Web (Dweb) and Its Cultural Foundations

With Sarah Grant and Regina Harsanyi.

## Overview

Since Sir Tim Berners Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 as a “universal linked information system” the web has grown to become the world’s dominant interface with the Internet. Throughout the web’s evolution, one of its core tenets has been “decentralization” – that this global network should allow anyone anywhere to create, share, and access digital content. In the 35 years since its inception, the web has fulfilled this promise in many ways. And yet some of its basic features have also proven to be vulnerable to powerful concentrated interests, enabling private and state actors to capture or censor the web.

This session will explore the history of the internet and the World Wide Web while analyzing the technologies, organizations, legislations, and ideologies that shaped the web over the past three and a half decades.
