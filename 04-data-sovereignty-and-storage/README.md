# Praxis 4: Data Sovereignty and Storage

with Kelani Nicole.

## Overview

The rise of Web 2.0 platforms in the 2010s created a massive economy around our data. Culture at large is now coming into an awareness of the hegemonies that have benefited from extracting our personal data: reducing our most precious resource –our relationships –into likes and followers, as we experienced the rise of surveillance capitalism. In the shift to decentralized web, we are realigning our understanding of the value of our data and taking back ownership and sovereignty over how our data is stored, accessed and parsed.

This session will start with a brief history of the infrastructure of the world wide web, specifically with the lens of a user’s relationship to their own data. In the workshop following, we’ll cooperatively map the data we value most asking: How can we re-imagine the value of our data? What can be our data used for? How can we share it with confidence? Distribute it? Take back ownership of where is it stored and how it is monetized? How can we ensure its longevity?

During this workshop session, participants will develop answers to these questions that make sense for their creative context, as we work collaboratively to map out the data we are generating and how that data can be leveraged as IP. Our objective will be to co-design an understanding of standardized protocols for privacy, sharing, and metadata concepts that can be used to parse data across our sovereignly owned data to demonstrate our individual and collective value beyond attendance, page likes, and ROI-driven engagement rates.

### Learning Outcomes
