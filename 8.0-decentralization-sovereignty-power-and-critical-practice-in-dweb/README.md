# Session 5: Decentralization: Sovereignty, Power, and Critical Practice in DWeb

with ngọc triệu and Ayana Zaire Cotton.

## Overview

Decentralization allows for the existence of diverse voices in a world of increasingly asymmetric power relations. Among other things, it enables alternative technologies to challenge traditional models — In situations where governments and corporate control are causing harm, decentralized technologies have the potential to bring about autonomy, resilience, and equity.

However, decentralization is often portrayed as a Western invention. When people discuss decentralization, it is frequently in response to the decentralization of technology, primarily within companies and organizations in the Global North. Our individual cultural background and knowledge influence how we define decentralization and perceive its impact on our society. When the decentralization discourse is dominated by a singular cultural perspective, to what extent can it fulfill the promise of reducing socio-economic disparities and power imbalances and strive towards a web of commons?

In this session, we will examine various facets of Dweb through the critical lens of decoloniality. We'll also explore how Dweb technologies — as a mode of being, thinking, and creating — enable us to co-design a more just and better digital futures.

### Learning Outcomes
