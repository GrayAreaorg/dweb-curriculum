# Session 8: Social and Community Impact

with Sarah Grant.

## Overview

Having a community built mesh network can be beneficial on several levels. Community networks offer the advantage of being built and maintained by people with a vested interest in accommodating and catering to whomever will be using the network. It also offers opportunities for members of the community to receive technical training in network engineering and infrastructure maintenance, web design and development, and to also give back by working as trainers or hosting network infrastructure within their homes. Community networks can also be a source of shared pride and social bonding over a shared effort that benefits everyone involved.

In this session, we will review examples of community networks from around the world created by and for folks from all different backgrounds, interests, and movements. We will also discuss how networks can be designed from the ground up, not just from a technical perspective, but also in terms of content, language and iconography offered on the community network platform.
