## Instructors

### Ayana Zaire Cotton
Ayana Zaire Cotton (she/they) is an interdisciplinary artist and cultural worker from Prince George’s County, Maryland. Braiding code, performance, and abstraction Ayana speculates and worldbuilds alongside science and technology. Sankofa is a word and symbol of the Akan Twi and Fante languages of Ghana which translates to, "go back and get". Centering a sankofa sensibility, they build databases as vessels holding seed data and experiment with shuffling algorithms to spin non-linear narratives. Ayana calls this methodology “Cykofa Narration”, generating new worlds using the digital and social detritus of our existing world — resulting in a storytelling aesthetic that embodies circular time and troubles human authorship. Through engaging with language, technology, and ecology, Ayana is cultivating a practice of remembering and imagining alternative modes of being and interspecies belonging.

### Kelani Nicole
Kelani Nichole is a technologist and founder of an experimental media art gallery called TRANSFER. She has been exploring decentralized networks and virtual worlds in contemporary art since 2013. Nichole's focus is supporting artists with critical technology practice, and exploring alternative models of cultural infrastructure. Currently she is building the TRANSFER Archive, a decentralized data trust and cooperative model for cultural value exchange, and producing a generative documentary film 'Almost in Real Time'.

### ngọc triệu
ngọc triệu (b. 1994, Vietnam) is a design researcher who practices design and research as interventions to address and reform asymmetrical power relations through the lenses of decoloniality and decentralisation. She's lived in Vietnam, Japan, the UK, and Germany where she's worked in open-source and public-interest technology, international development, humanitarian aid, pedagogical design, documentary photography, and film-making. When ngọc isn't busy distilling data into insights or contemplating ways of decolonial being, she enjoys working with clay, doing Kendo (Japanese sword-fighting), and taking long walks in the mountains.
