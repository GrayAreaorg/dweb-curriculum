# Praxis 1: Command Line for Creatives

With Sarah Grant and Sarah Friend.

## Overview

Following online tutorials or trying to get up and running with various dweb tools often involves using the command line interface, or cli, but they rarely actually teach cli itself. It can get forgotten or overlooked, and experienced programmers tend to forget they ever learned it. This class will focus on cli exclusively, looking at foundational skills that will make all other explorations of software development and dweb more approachable. A little familiarity goes a long way: many small computer tasks can be done with the command line: create and read files, running programs, checking on what your computer is currently doing, etc - and with time and practice, huge productivity, new approaches to using your computer, and yes, even fun, can be unlocked.

### Learning Outcomes

* Confidence to utilize the bash command line.
* Understanding essential navigation, file manipulation, and system control commands.
* The ability to create shell scripts for automating operations and applications.

### Materials Needed

* A computer, ideally running Linux or macOS.
* A computer or device with Zoom installed, with camera and microphone.

### Prerequisites

* If using Windows [install Git BASH, which is bundled with some other tools here](https://gitforwindows.org/).
