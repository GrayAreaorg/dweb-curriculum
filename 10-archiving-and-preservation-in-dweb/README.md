# Praxis 4: Archiving and Preservation in DWeb

with Regina Harsanyi

## Overview

Decentralized tooling may appear to be a useful evolution in archiving, preservation, and conservation of born-digital and digitized material but what you put into a decentralized system is what you get out of it. This course will teach you how to prepare files for decentralized archiving, including file organization, naming, telling the difference between archival and non-archival files, and encryption methods. Learn what metadata to include and how to write a checksum that verifies your files haven’t changed. You will then learn to tell the difference between good decentralized resources for storing files versus not so useful choices. We’ll also discuss why decentralized practices in archiving at large have not been adopted.

### Learning Outcomes

* How to export organize, encrypt, and verify born-digital and digitized files that are precious to you.
* How to differentiate between useful and risky decentralized tooling for archiving.
* How to upload and use a decentralized network for archival purposes.
