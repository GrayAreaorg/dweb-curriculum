# Session 6: Diversification of Storage Practices

with Regina Harsanyi and Kelani Nicole.

## Overview

Stanford University articulated one of the most important tenets of digital preservation, LOCKSS or “Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe.” But keeping many copies of a file in the same location has dire consequences. Diversifying where our cultural heritage, personal and otherwise, is kept is just as important as making copies at all. How can we use decentralized tooling to maximize digital preservation? What tools, both in hardware and software, exist to help facilitate keeping our files safe, and how do we network them together for the purpose of community archiving? We’ll learn about the pros and cons of running your own server, maintaining your own preservation hardware, offline storage, online storage, and security. Two case studies, the Current Museum and TRANSFER Data Trust, will ground these tools in real-world examples.

### Learning Outcomes

* Survey of Decentralized Storage Hardware and Software (Personal computers,mobile, dedicated hardware)
* Pros and Cons of each approach to storage
* Case studies / demos of preservation grade decentralized storage systems (The Current / TRANSFER Data Trust, Internet Archive)

### Materials Needed

* A computer or device with Zoom installed, with camera and microphone.

### Prerequisites

* None
